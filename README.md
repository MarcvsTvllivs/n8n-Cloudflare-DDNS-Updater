# n8n-Cloudflare-DDNS-Updater
n8n Workflows for AI agent-aided IP updaters for Cloudflare DDNS. The issue I am trying to solve is that existing updaters tend to just update specific record/subdomains that are manually set, not all records/subdomains in a Cloudflare Zone. With these Workflows, a lightweight AI agent (defaults to ChatGPT 5 nano) determines and updates all.
